# ``Trimtastic``

Goals for V1:
Loading of video files and visually displaying them as "Filmstrips", such as in Final Cut
Make multiple partial selections of the Filmstips possible
Hover scrub 
Use "Trim" feature to quickly separate the videos and export them


Goals for V2:
Tie into FCP 
    make it possible to trim files which are used in projects (currently if trimmed, the marked Favorits, etc are lost, and Projects loose their connection to the clip)
